# Advancing CNC Machining Efficiency: A Machine Learning-Based Tool Wear Detection and Monitoring System

## Project Description

In this pioneering master's thesis project, I am spearheading the development of an end-to-end software solution leveraging the power of machine learning to revolutionize the detection and monitoring of tool wear damage in CNC machining processes. By harnessing cutting-edge algorithms and techniques in artificial intelligence, this innovative software aims to enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and predictive capabilities of tool wear assessment in manufacturing environments.

Under the expert guidance and supervision of Msc. Danny Schröter, a distinguished Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter at IWF TU Berlin, this thesis delves into the intricate complexities of CNC machining processes and the pivotal role played by tool wear in determining production quality and operational costs. Through rigorous research, experimentation, and iterative refinement, the proposed software solution seeks to bridge the gap between traditional methodologies and the demands of modern machining practices.

## Key Objectives

- Development of robust machine learning models capable of detecting subtle signs of tool wear.
- Integration of real-time monitoring functionalities to facilitate proactive maintenance strategies.
- Establishment of a user-friendly interface for seamless integration into existing manufacturing workflows.
